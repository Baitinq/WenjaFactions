# WenjaFactions
The iHCF fork that WenjaPvP used.
- Many bug fixes by me.
- Fixed a couple memory leaks (memes).
- Re-worked deathbans.
- Re-worked lives.
- Removed MySQL support.
- More but cba

Dependencies
- Spigot 1.7
- ProtocolLib 3.7.0
- GNU Trove 3.0.3
- Guava 21.0
- Commons Lang 3
- Commons Collections 4.1
- Lombok (plugin + library)

Trove, Guava, and both Commons libraries need to be exported with the project.

Be sure to keep a lookout for my new core that will wipe iHCF off of MCM.
